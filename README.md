# @transmute/jsonld

This package is a wrapper around the original `jsonld` package published by digitalbazaar as found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonld

This package contains all of the same functions in addition to a newly added `safeCanonize` function that will prevent you from canonizing data that is not properly formatted JSON-LD.
